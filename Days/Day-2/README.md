## Description

### Part 1

The assignment was to get the ammount of valid lists.  
a valid list is one that is only ascending or descending, and the difference between each neighbor is at lease 1 and at most 3.

My solution: `356`

### Part 2

Same assignment, but now you can exclude 1 number of the list.

My solution: `413`
