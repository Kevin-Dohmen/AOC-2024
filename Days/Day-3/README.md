## Description

### Part 1

The assignment was to run through long strings and extract `mul(x, y)` operations, multiply the 2 items in the multiply operation and add up all operaiton solutions.

My solution: `190604937`

### Part 2

The same as part 1, but this time `do()` anables the next operations and `don't()` disables the next operations.

My solution: `82857512`
